# Assetto Corsa Laptime Tracker
## Overview
This GitHub repository contains two Python scripts designed to enhance your sim-racing experience by automating lap-time tracking and data Management

## Main Features
main2.py: This script reads a .JSON File generated by a server, extracts essential lap-time data, and compiles it into an Excel spreadsheet for long-term monitoring.

learnFTP.py: Automatically retrieves the necessary .JSON files for seamless data access and processing.

## Project Goals
The primary aim of this project was to master Python in a practical way that resonated with my passion for sim-racing. By integrating Python skills with my hobby, I aimed to create a tool that enhances my racing performance analysis.

## Additional Benefits
Beyond improving my skillset, this project aimed to track lap times consistently to observe incremental improvements over sessions.
Captured details include:
- driver
- car make
- car model
- track name
- sector times
- total lap-time

## Challenges
While the project did achieve significant progress, certain challenges arose:
  - No constant access to the server, which made it difficult to diagnose the encoding issues that were arising.
  - Encountered encoding issues with the .JSON files generated by the racing server
Despite attempts to resolve this issue programmatically, a manual copy-paste workaround was temporarily adopted. Though not fully completed due to personal commitments, like being a full-time student, this repository showcases my dedication to combining Python proficiency with my passion for sim-racing.
